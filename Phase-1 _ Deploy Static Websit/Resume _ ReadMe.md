Great question! Here’s a clear and professional way to explain your **Project 1 – Static Website Deployment to EC2** in a resume, interview, LinkedIn post, or class report. I’ll break it into short sections based on your use case.

---

## ✅ 1. **Resume Bullet (DevOps / Cloud Focused)**

> **Deployed a static website to AWS EC2 using Apache and GitHub**

* Launched and configured an Ubuntu-based EC2 instance on AWS
* Installed and configured Apache web server to host HTTP traffic
* Created and pushed a static website to GitHub
* Manually cloned and deployed website content from GitHub to EC2 using secure SSH access
* Configured security groups to control SSH and HTTP access using public IP and open ports

## ✅ 3. **LinkedIn Post (Professional Tone)**

🚀 **Just completed a foundational DevOps project!**
I deployed a static website to an Ubuntu-based EC2 instance on AWS. This hands-on project involved:

* Launching and securing a cloud server with SSH
* Installing Apache to serve HTTP traffic
* Hosting and managing code with GitHub
* Manually deploying site content from GitHub to EC2
* Configuring AWS security groups for access control

This project sharpened my understanding of cloud infrastructure, Linux server setup, and manual deployment workflows — all crucial DevOps skills.
💡 Next: Automating this process with CI/CD tools like GitHub Actions!

## ✅ 4. **Interview Response (When Asked “Tell me about a project you worked on”)**

> Sure! One project I recently completed involved deploying a static website to an AWS EC2 instance. I launched an Ubuntu instance, configured it with Apache, and secured it with SSH and firewall rules. I then created a static HTML website, pushed it to GitHub, and manually cloned the repository onto my EC2 server to host it. This helped me build a strong understanding of basic DevOps practices like provisioning infrastructure, managing Linux web servers, using Git for version control, and manually deploying code from GitHub. It was a great intro to hands-on cloud development.
